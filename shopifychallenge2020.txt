Question 1: Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set

On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

a. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
b. What metric would you report for this dataset?
c. What is its value?


Answer:  The dataset has some outliers at the end (right skewed with high order amount values /low total_amounts). Since mean is affected by skewed distributions, hence AOV is 3145.13 and is not the best indicator. For this dataset median will be a better indicator of the average price of the show which is 284.
